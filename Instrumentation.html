          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As you likely
              already know, radiation cannot be readily detected by the human
              senses (sight, sound, smell, touch or taste).&nbsp; To </font><font

              need some help...specifically we require some sort of radiation
              detection instrumentation.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
              A variety of hand-held and laboratory instruments are available
              for detecting and measuring radiation.&nbsp; Although there are a
              very wide variety of instrument, the most common hand-held or
              portable instruments are:</font></p>
          <div align="justify">
            <p> </p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Geiger
                  Counter, with Geiger-Mueller (GM) Tube or Probe</strong></font><font
                face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> — A GM tube is a
                gas-filled device that, when a high voltage is applied, creates
                an electrical pulse when radiation interacts with the wall or
                gas in the tube. These pulses are converted to a reading on the
                instrument meter. If the instrument has a speaker, the pulses
                also give an audible click. <strong>Sodium Iodide (NaI)
                  Detector</strong> — A solid crystal of sodium iodide creates a
                pulse of light when radiation interacts with it.&nbsp; This
                pulse of light is converted to an electrical signal by a
                photomultiplier tube (PMT), which gives a reading on the
                instrument meter. The pulse of light is proportional to the
                amount of light and the energy deposited in the crystal. These
                instruments most often have upper and lower energy discriminator
                circuits, and when used correctly as a single channel analyzer,
                can provide information on the gamma energy and identify the
                radioactive material.&nbsp; If the instrument has a speaker, the
                pulses also give an audible click. A useful feature when looking
                for a lost source.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">
                &nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Portable
                  Multichannel Analyzer</strong> — A sodium iodide crystal and
                PMT described above, coupled with a small multichannel analyzer
                (MCA) electronics package, are becoming much more affordable and
                common. When gamma ray data libraries and automatic gamma ray
                energy identification procedures are employed, these hand-held
                instruments can automatically identify and display the type of
                radioactive materials present. <br>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Ionization
                  (Ion) Chamber</strong> — An air filled chamber with a
                electrically conductive inner wall and central anode and a
                relatively low applied voltage. When primary ion pairs are
                formed in the air volume, from x ray or gamma radiation
                interactions in the chamber wall, the central anode collects the
                electrons and a small current is generated. This in turn is
                measured by an electrometer circuit and displayed digitally or
                on an analog meter. These instruments must be calibrated
                properly to a traceable radiation source, are designed to
                provide and accurate measure of absorbed dose to air, which thru
                appropriate conversion factors, can be related to dose to
                tissue. In that most ion chambers are "open air," they must be
                corrected for change in temperature and pressure. <br>

            <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Neutron
                  REM Meter, with Proportional Counter</strong> — A boron
                trifluoride (BF3) or helium-3 (He-3) proportional counter tube
                is a gas-filled device that, when a high voltage is applied,
                creates an electrical pulse when a neutron radiation interacts
                with the gas in the tube. The absorption of a neutron in the
                nucleus of boron-10 or helium-3 causes the prompt emission of a
                helium-4 nucleus or proton respectively. These charged particles
                can then cause ionization in the gas, which is collected as
                caused an electrical pulse, similar to the GM tube. These
                neutron measuring proportional counters require large amounts of
                hydrogenous material around them to slow the neutron to thermal
                energies. Other surrounding filters allow an appropriate number
                of neutrons to be detected, and thus provide a flat energy
                response with respect to dose equivalent. The design and
                characteristics of these devises are such that, the amount of
                secondary charge collected is proportional to the degree of
                primary ions produced by the radiation. Thus, thru the use of
                electronic discriminator circuits, the different types of
                radiation can be measured separately. For example, gamma
                radiation up to rather high levels is easily rejected in neutron
                counters.</font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong></strong></font></p>

                  Detectors </strong>— A number of different techniques are
                used for radon measurements in home or occupational settings
                (e.g., uranium mines). These range from collection of radon
                decay products on an air filter and counting, exposing a
                charcoal canister for several days and performing gamma
                spectroscopy for absorbed decay products, exposure of an
                electret ion chamber and read-out, and long-term exposure of
                CR-39 plastic with subsequent chemical etching and alpha track
                counting. All these approaches have different advantages and
                disadvantages which should be evaluated prior to use.&nbsp;</font></p>

          <h3><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The most

          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Liquid
                Scintillation Counters</strong> — A liquid scintillation counter
              (LSC) is a traditional laboratory instrument with two opposing
              PMTs that view a vial that contains a sample and liquid
              scintillator fluid, or cocktail. When the sample emits a radiation
              (often a low energy beta) the cocktail itself being the detector
              causes a pulse of light. If both PMTs detect the light in
              coincidence, the count is tallied. With the use of shielding,
              cooling of PMTs, energy discrimination, and this coincidence
              counting approach, very low background counts can be achieved, and
              thus low minimum detectable activities (MDA). Most modern LSC
              units have multiple sample capability, and automatic data
              acquisition, reduction and storage.</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><br>

          <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Proportional
                Counter</strong> — A common laboratory instrument is the
              standard proportional counter with sample counting tray and
              chamber, and argon/methane flow thru counting gas. Most units
              employ a very thin (microgram/cm2) window, while some are
              windowless. Shielding and identical guard chambers are used to
              reduce background, and in conjunction with electronic
              discrimination, these instruments can distinguish between alpha
              and beta radiation, and achieve low minimum detectable activities
              (MDAs).&nbsp; Similar to the LSC units noted above, these
              proportional counters have multiple sample capability, and
              automatic data acquisition, reduction and storage. Such counters
              are often used to count smear / wipe or air filter samples.
              Additionally, large area gas flow proportional counters with thin
              (milligram/cm2) mylar windows are used for counting the whole body
              and extremities of workers for external contamination when exiting
              a radiological control area.</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong><br>

                Analyzer System</strong> — A laboratory MCA with a sodium iodide
              crystal and PMT (described above), solid-state germanium or
              silicon type detectors can provide a powerful and useful
              capability for counting liquid or solid matrix samples, or other
              prepared extracted radioactive sample. Most systems are used for
              gamma counting, while some silicon detectors are used for alpha
              radiation. These MCA systems can also be utilized with well
              shielded detectors to count internally deposited radioactive
              material in organs or tissue for bioassay measurements. In all
              cases the MCA provides the capability to bin and tally counts by
              energy, and thus identify the emitter. Again, most systems have
              automatic data acquisition, reduction and storage capability.</font></p>
